    "overview": "Akene is sharp, structured, inquisitive, and driven by the Chigiri clan’s rigid traditions surrounding fate and information. In Part I she appears confident, disciplined, and composed—believing that fulfilling one’s destined role is the key to success. Beneath that structure, she is analytical, observant, and naturally strategic, often reading people and situations faster than her peers. As she grows older, disillusionment with the Leaf and her clan’s demands turns her increasingly cynical, guarded, and emotionally detached. She remains an intel-first shinobi who values knowledge, purpose, and order, yet struggles deeply with sudden change, incompetence, and losing control of her path.",

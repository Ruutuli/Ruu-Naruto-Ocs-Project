  summary: 'The Chigiri Clan is an ancient, intelligence-driven clan with origins tied to Kaguya Ōtsutsuki\'s era. Known for Divine Release, their fate-reading Kekkei Genkai, and their role as the reincarnating vessels of the madousho, they are scholars, diviners, and information brokers. Their main branch stays neutral in the Land of Iron while branch families support every major hidden village.',
  affiliation: 'Neutral (Main Branch), Multi-Village (Branch Families)',
  classification: 'Shinobi Clan',
  status: 'Active',
  village: 'Land of Iron',
  overview: {
    origins: 'The Chigiri Clan originates from a tragedy involving Rei, a handmaiden of Kaguya Ōtsutsuki who became the first living madousho after accidentally triggering Kaguya\'s Soul Binding Seal. Rei\'s descendants inherited fragments of the seal, eventually forming a clan shaped by forbidden knowledge, divination, and an obsession with fate. Eikene Chigiri and Yasha Ōtsutsuki formally became the founders of the clan, intentionally shaping future generations around the madousho\'s protection and the pursuit of knowledge.',
    knownFor: '- Masters of intelligence gathering and fate-reading\n- Bone divination and chakra-infused bone craftsmanship\n- The Divine Release Kekkei Genkai (seeing red strings of fate)\n- Maintaining vast library networks across all major villages\n- Producing seers, analysts, archivists, spies, and political advisors\n- An almost cult-like dedication to tradition, lineage, and destiny',
    purpose: 'The Chigiri act as the shinobi world\'s **keepers of knowledge** and **interpreters of fate**. Their primary purpose is to:\n- Preserve the reincarnating madousho\n- Protect forbidden information from misuse\n- Maintain historical continuity\n- Support villages through intelligence, not direct warfare\n- Observe fate without interfering with it\n\nThey serve as the "invisible backbone" of information flow across nations.',
    fitInUniverse: 'The Chigiri seamlessly integrate into every major shinobi nation as non-combat support specialists. Their neutrality, political value, and deep historical roots make them:\n- Essential during inter-village diplomacy\n- Highly respected (but also distrusted) for their vast knowledge\n- A quiet counterbalance to clans like the Hyūga and Uchiha\n- A neutral, scholarly force in a world shaped by war\n\nTheir existence explains how hidden villages maintain records of ancient knowledge that predates their founding, as the Chigiri have been preserving such information for centuries.'

    description: 'Divine Release grants the user the ability to perceive **red strings of fate** that represent the life paths, connections, and potential destinies of individuals.\n\nThese strings do not show a single future, but **multiple branching outcomes**, each tinted with emotional or spiritual resonance.\n\nUsers cannot change fate — they can **only observe, interpret, and guide**.\n\nThis ability originates from the spiritual residue of the madousho and the diluted Ōtsutsuki lineage within the clan.',

  clanHistory: {
    ancientEra: 'Long before ninja villages or clans existed, long before chakra became a tool of war, there lived a quiet handmaiden named **Rei**. She served Kaguya Ōtsutsuki faithfully, tending to her twin sons. Rei\'s life was unremarkable until the day she discovered Kaguya\'s madousho — a grimoire filled with divine knowledge, personal secrets, and forbidden jutsu. It was a book no human was meant to see.\n\nThe moment Rei opened the cover, the Soul Binding Talisman activated. Her soul should have been devoured, just like the countless others whose voices were trapped inside those pages. But she was holding Hamura at the time. His infant chakra — a perfect echo of Kaguya\'s own — interfered with the curse.\n\nInstead of consuming Rei, the book emptied into her.\n\nRei collapsed on the floor, eyes vacant, the pages inside the grimoire suddenly blank. Whatever she had been before vanished. Her memories, her emotions, her personality — all gone. She became something new: the first **living madousho**, a human archive containing every soul and every secret the book had ever absorbed.\n\nRei soon gave birth to a son, **Taro**, the only word her hollowed mind could utter. Her relatives, heartbroken and furious at what Kaguya had done to their sweet Rei, raised the boy themselves. They fed him every story of what had happened, every rumor, every grief-soaked whisper. From childhood onward, Taro grew up believing one thing:\n\nThe Ōtsutsuki had destroyed his mother.\n\nEven after Kaguya\'s sealing, Taro never found Rei again. Her body had vanished, leaving only the curse behind.\n\nAs Taro grew older, that resentment hardened into obsession. He became fixated on the curse that had shaped his family. He believed that if the Ōtsutsuki had taken his mother from him, then he would take back everything from them — their bloodline, their power, their legacy. Revenge and fear twisted into purpose. Taro decided he would create a clan strong enough to outlive the gods themselves.\n\nHis only child, **Eikene**, was born with a strange quietness to her. She sometimes seemed to know things she had never been taught, recalling facts or histories she could not possibly have learned. Taro saw Rei\'s mark in her. He did not understand the seal she carried — only that it terrified him. Determined to sever the family\'s tie to the Ōtsutsuki once and for all, he sought help from Hamura\'s distant descendants.\n\nThis decision led him to **Yasha Ōtsutsuki**, a brilliant but infamously disagreeable exile whose behavior had rendered him unwelcome on the moon. Taro intended to use Yasha\'s chakra to break his daughter\'s curse, but the plan collapsed the moment Eikene and Yasha met. Against all expectation, they grew close. Taro\'s unease only worsened when they eloped, choosing a life together far from his control.\n\nTheir marriage — unapproved, unpredictable — became the spark that eventually gave rise to the Chigiri.\n\nEikene and Yasha had four children. None inherited the Byakugan, though two were born with a strange pink tint to their eyes, mutated remnants of a Kekkei Genkai their bodies could no longer manifest. The curse within Rei\'s bloodline had already sealed their fates: no foreign Kekkei Genkai could ever bloom again.\n\nTaro died believing he had failed. Yet, in a twist of irony he never lived to see, Eikene and Yasha became the first generation of what would someday be known as the Chigiri Clan.\n\nYears later, after Eikene\'s passing, a child was born into the family with markings across her skin — spirals of faded seals, faint but unmistakably divine. Her name was **Miki**, the first awakened madousho since Rei.\n\nGuided by the Ōtsutsuki chakra running in their veins, the elders unlocked the dormant seal within her. Miki gained full access to the ancient archive, but unlike Rei, she retained her identity. She learned to turn the madousho on and off, controlling it instead of being consumed by it.\n\nThrough Miki, Divine Release was born — a new art born from the fusion of Rei\'s inherited seal and Yasha\'s divination. She called it **Tengenjutsu**. This ability to see the strings of fate became the Chigiri Clan\'s defining power, and its limitations shaped the doctrine they would follow:\n\nObserve fate.\nRecord fate.\nDo not interfere.\n\nThose who tried to bend destiny suffered for it.\n\nMiki formalized the structure of the early clan. She created the first council, established the laws of marriage, sealed away knowledge of the madousho from all but the leaders, and laid the foundation for many traditions that would outlast kingdoms and empires.\n\nThis was also the era of Kaō and Botan — legendary scholars whose brilliance was overshadowed by their rivalry. Their violent clash left a deep psychic scar on the clan. Something in the Chigiri bloodline reacted, birthing the first whisper of the curse that would later prevent Chigiri from harming one another. Their fight became a cautionary tale passed down through generations.\n\nBy the end of the Ancient Era, the Chigiri had become something new:\nan emerging clan shaped by tragedy, obsession, divination, and fate itself.',
    feudalEra: 'As the world grew more chaotic and human conflict intensified, the early Chigiri settled into a secluded region far from expanding nations. Under Miki\'s teachings, they crafted their identity:\n\nThey grew their hair long as a sign of loyalty.\nThey married within carefully controlled bloodlines.\nThey raised children communally to preserve knowledge.\nThey accepted destiny as absolute truth — something one obeyed, not questioned.\n\nFull-blooded, tightly controlled lineages became essential. Children born with defects, or with chakra imbalances that suggested the seal could destabilize, were removed from the family in quiet tragedy. Beauty, intelligence, and potential for divination were all traits selected for.\n\nTheir culture became strict, ritualistic, and deeply traditional.\n\nDuring this period the clan perfected boneworking. Rabbits were raised on chakra-infused pellets, their short life spans and lunar symbolism tied to the clan\'s divination rituals. Their bones were carved for readings, while larger beasts provided material for weapons.\n\nEvery child grew up knowing how to read bones, how to interpret fate threads, and how to obey the Council. Miki\'s influence shaped the clan long after her death, as her writings — and every madousho after her — preserved each era\'s knowledge in perfect detail.\n\nThe clan spread into branch families based on aptitude: some were bred for sealing techniques, others for chakra manipulation, others for espionage or scholarly pursuits. The earliest versions of the Fire, Earth, Wind, Lightning, and Water branches emerged here, though they had not yet joined the villages that would later bear those names.\n\nThe Feudal Era was also when the Chigiri became truly feared. Small lords hired them as prophets, advisors, and information brokers. Their predictions saved kingdoms and toppled them. They became infamous for approaching war not with swords, but with secrets.\n\nThe Chigiri never built armies.\nThey built archives — and archives were far more dangerous.',
    foundingOfVillages: 'When the era of shinobi warfare began, the Chigiri found themselves in a precarious position. Every great clan wanted their knowledge. Every lord wanted their predictions. But the Chigiri themselves wanted neither allegiance nor conquest.\n\nThey survived by offering information, never loyalty.\n\nIt was during one of these conflicts that the violence curse resurfaced. Younger Chigiri, manipulated into opposing sides, found themselves unable to harm each other. Their bodies rebelled violently against the idea. Elders took this as divine proof: the clan was meant to remain united, no matter how the world fractured around them.\n\nTheir neutrality became legendary.\nTheir numbers continued to swell.\nTheir reputation as a "cult of scholars" grew.\n\nBy the end of the Warring States Period, they were everywhere and nowhere — a clan that influenced events yet claimed no territory.\n\nWhen the Hidden Villages formed, the Chigiri faced a crisis. Their secluded homeland was no longer sufficient for their rapidly expanding population. Their libraries were overflowing, their traditions too rigid to dilute, and their bloodline too fragile to survive complete isolation.\n\nThe Council made a fateful decision: the Chigiri would become a multi-village clan.\n\nThe **Main Branch** relocated to neutral territory, eventually settling in the Land of Iron — a place protected from shinobi politics, perfect for the quiet governance of the madousho.\n\nBranch families were dispatched to every major village.\n\nEach branch specialized depending on the land they settled in:\n\n- Fire for medical and barrier arts\n- Earth for sealing and summoning\n- Wind for transformation and wind manipulation\n- Lightning for space-time and cursed seals\n- Water for chakra absorption and forbidden arts\n\nEvery village accepted them.\nEvery Kage feared them.\n\nThey signed treaties only under strict conditions:\nautonomy, neutrality, and the right for each council to remain under Main Family authority — not village authority.\n\nTheir libraries became the intellectual backbone of every Hidden Village. Their analysts deciphered enemy strategies. Their diviners prevented political disasters. Their archivists preserved information that predated the village systems themselves.\n\nThe Chigiri did not become warriors.\nThey became indispensable.',
    modernEra: 'Today, the Chigiri are one of the largest clans in the world. Their branches are deeply embedded in every village\'s operations. Their neutrality remains unbroken, and their political value is immeasurable.\n\nBut beneath the surface, the clan is fraying.\n\nThe madousho continues to reincarnate, each vessel inheriting the knowledge of all who came before. Modern vessels, like Akene, live under crushing pressure — sealed tongues, fake fates, forced obedience, and overwhelming torrents of ancient information.\n\nYounger members chafe under tradition.\nOlder members insist destiny must be obeyed.\nThe Council grows more controlling each decade.\nThe curse preventing infighting distorts interpersonal conflict.\nAnd the clan\'s obsession with knowledge has become both its strength and its cage.\n\nThe Chigiri are thriving.\nThe Chigiri are suffering.\nThe Chigiri endure.\n\nTheir guiding belief remains unchanged from the day Rei opened the madousho:\n\n**"There is no malice in information. Only in how it is used."**'

      '### **Lantern of Rei — origin & purpose**\nA lantern said to contain Rei\'s lingering chakra.\n\nIt glows according to the vessel\'s emotional shifts.\n\nOnly elders may ignite it.\n\nTaboo: Lighting it during childbirth is strictly forbidden after a past tragedy.',
      '### **Ribbon of Lineage — origin & purpose**\nA silk-and-chakra ribbon tied into every child\'s hair at their first fate reading.\n\nBranch colors differ by lineage.\n\nOnly elders may remove or retie it.\n\nTaboo: Cutting the ribbon represents severing destiny.',
      '### **Eldertree Scroll — origin & purpose**\nA blank, sealed scroll said to reveal its contents only to a fully awakened madousho.\n\nNo one has opened it in centuries.\n\nTaboo: Breaking the wax seal is believed to curse future vessels.',
      '### **Unbroken Diamond Staff — origin & purpose**\nA ceremonial staff carved to mirror the clan crest: a diamond within a diamond.\n\nUsed during funerary rites to "guide" the departed soul through the 49-day cycle.\n\nOnly the funeral priest may wield it.\n\nTaboo: Using it for non-funeral rituals desecrates the spirit.'

    secretKnowledge: '### **The True Nature of the Madousho**\n\nThe madousho is not simply information — it is a composite soul built from every consciousness Kaguya\'s grimoire consumed.\n\nRei\'s presence lingers in every vessel.\n\nOnly Clan Head and vessel know this in full.\n\n### **The Violence Curse**\n\nA hereditary curse born from early clan trauma.\n\nChakra instinctively prevents Chigiri from harming each other, causing recoil, paralysis, nausea, or emotional collapse.\n\nVillages do not know this exists.\n\n### **Forbidden Tengenjutsu**\n\nLost or sealed-off forms created by Miki:\n- fate-rerouting techniques\n- lineage-thread manipulation\n- catastrophic destiny-breaking arts\n\nAll are locked under the Main Branch.\n\n### **Forgotten Treaties**\n\nSecret agreements with pre-Hyūga lineages, daimyo families, and forgotten lunar-descended clans.\n\nThese explain why Chigiri libraries were never targeted for destruction.\n\n### **Catastrophic Lineage Secret**\n\nIf the Chigiri bloodline ever ends, the madousho\'s contents will scatter across the world — releasing centuries of forbidden jutsu, political secrets, lineage histories, and absorbed souls.\n\nEvery village would immediately seek to capture pieces of it.\n\nThis is the true reason the clan must never die.'
